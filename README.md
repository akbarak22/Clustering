This project focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups to enable personalized marketing strategies. The process includes data cleaning, feature construction (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), and outlier removal. An elbow graph was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and customer segments were visualized in both 2D and 3D. The model achieved a silhouette score of 0.61, effectively grouping customers into three categories based on RFM analysis for targeted marketing.
